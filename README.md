# DGP_Sim
--- data generating process simulator ----

This function simulates a data generating process, by drawing random samples according to a distribution of choice from

  standard gaussian
  gaussian with fat tails
  gamma
  
 distribution.
 
In addition, to the standard parameters of a data simulator, the number of non-linear features, number of irrelevant features and highest polynomial degree can be chosen.

It can be used to simulate data for binary classification problems or regression problems.
